<p>I am passionate about Embedded stuffs.</p>
<p>Day 1:</p>
<p>Total chaos&hellip;</p>
<p>they introduced 42 concepts and tribe concepts. Also notion and suggested to profile our self : ended in chaos, as instructed students started to copy/clone, edit the profile from everyone. The profile owners got frustrated and started to freaking out. After some meetings, it was regulated. There is a gamification concept  through which we get points for community meetings, peer meeting, for being online in discord. (interesting). There is also eggs hidden somewhere. i found one successfully at the moment. Everything happens in discord channel, entered into new server from today. speak with robot to get authenticated. :!help</p>
<p>Day 2:</p>
<p>Interesting discussions and subscribed for all event.</p>
<p>Yesterday, i forgot to subscribe to all events. Today basecamp is introduced.I tested it, running good. A linux machine with limited apps available (geeky). Personality test session(t is a nice session about team building and management) super interesting, made and submitted a zortify personality test analysis, a fingerprint of my self evaluation about my character.</p>

<p>Day 3:</p>
<p>It is the day actually wolfsburg concept started interesting to me. Everybody here are open and cool. All pisiciners can help. Hey, this is a hub where we can evolve better. (Oh ye !). Today the talk from Oliver Hartkopp, gave me new perceptive. He is a opensource guy and getting paid from Volkswagen(COOL). He explained CAN protocol and common troubleshooting problems. Very helpful and informative for me.  Get to know about pomodora timer.(What is this?). Did i heard today points doesn`t matters (i worked hard for it) 😮</p>
<p>Day 4:</p>
<p>Today, we had a live session with Vint Cerf (The Father of Internet). His life was inspiring. He suggested many books. I have updated my learning list. ! 😉</p>

<p>Day 5:</p>
<p>First daily check in, I computer got crashed. I think i got bad opinion from my tribe members. 🥶  Then somehow i sent personal message. They were kind and didnt respond me anything rude. 😌Atlast, I fixed my first c code with norminette. The second kick off meeting went funny and cool. (upto you guys). They explained exams, voting event, rush project and other projects. There was a interesting discussion about gender bias in channel.</p>

<p>[42] Jan02/11/2021</p>
<p>Hello @everyone
In case there is another vogsphere server issue in the future, we collected some DOs and DON&rsquo;Ts for the case of a server down time. You find them in the notion guide:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/42wolfsburg/Tech-manual-e1100dd958cc44f9813485740f81769c">https://www.notion.so/42wolfsburg/Tech-manual-e1100dd958cc44f9813485740f81769c</a></p>
<p>👏 👏 👏 applause..</p>
<p>Day 12:</p>
<p>c 01:  Think slow.. have the big picture in mind. Today i learned to pass the function into a function.</p>
<p>forgot to register for rush &hellip; rush seams to be easy. 150points. The event was not listed on intra events.       ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>Day 13:</p>
<p>made a test script cool—c01. Haha 🤫 my test cases failed a peer(shell 00 ex07) but, the moulinette passed him.</p>
<p>¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>Day14:</p>
<p>spending time with loved ones is also important. Need to look into big picture. Happy valentines day 😂..</p>
<p><img src="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Screenshot_from_2021-02-14_06-01-45.png" alt="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Screenshot_from_2021-02-14_06-01-45.png"></p>
<p>Why am i trying to increase these stupid points ? ¯*(ツ)*/¯ . it is not at all logical. total 1437 → 1443,.  After what am i running..???</p>
<p>what basecamp Server down oh no&hellip;! oh no recent commits on last work..</p>
<p>Made chappathis and enjoyed the dinner. 😅</p>
<p>Day 15:</p>
<p>yesterday i could not able to work on c02 and slept soon. Starting with c02. I hope basecamp server was not in hungry to eat any of my data during its short snap. 😅</p>
<p>ex06 char c = &lsquo;\x7f&rsquo;   <a href="//valid">//valid</a></p>
<p>but,  char string[] = &lsquo;\x7fdai&rsquo;   <a href="//hexadecimal">//hexadecimal</a> value out of range in clang llvm.. but works in gcc -9.(local machine) ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>gcc is doing good in out of bound errors. The trick here is 🤫 : they are using clang LLVM in basecamp server virtual machine but this moulinette is seams to be executing using gcc.(but why are you guys doing it? 😵)</p>
<p><a href="https://easyaspi314.github.io/gcc-vs-clang.html">GCC vs Clang vs MSVC Diagnostics</a></p>
<p><img src="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Untitled%202.png" alt="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Untitled%202.png"></p>

<p>Tricky &hellip;</p>
<p>wow.. this i love this exercise ex12. Thank you.. need time(!)</p>
<p>commit journey:—&gt; initial commit—&gt;draft—&gt;tested—&gt; norminnette—&gt; final version—&gt;(if)corrections(go and start with initial commit)</p>
<p>Day 16:</p>
<p>Good morning to have a fresh start c03..  loop(draft it and test it)</p>
<p><img src="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Untitled%203.png" alt="Learning%20Journals%20c2eccd8b45e348ef9b7f491b420d2322/Untitled%203.png"></p>
<p>I have tested mulitple times with different test case. failed okay.. but why ??  ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>Jan (from wolfpack) announced that, they were working to fix it. let us wait and see&hellip;</p>
<p>They Fixed but i failed. its good.(found the problem in my test case)</p>
<p>difference between a[] = &ldquo;A&rdquo;;  &ldquo;A&rdquo; passing directly makes difference. But it should not.</p>
<p>Day 17:</p>
<p>Evaluavated &hellip; half a day..</p>
<p>found some missed test cases by moulinette 🤫</p>
<p>failed. and thank you moulinete.. I learned the significance of flags</p>
<p>Day18:</p>
<p>What is time out error. ? infinite loop. failing failing ..</p>
<p>Lessons learned one project at a time.</p>
<p>Day19:</p>
<p>At last passed c02. After so many trials. but no one knows the correct answer. How to move further in that ? Thanks Abdul( a tribe member) cleared many doubts. Exams not prepared enough. need to prepare next time. Seams that they will not test skills based on the finished exercises as they told at start. ¯*(ツ)*/¯  need to work hard on it. could not able to handle double pointer comfortably, failed to clear all the test cases.</p>
<p>Day 20:</p>
<p>Had meeting with rush guys.  and also worked a lot to finish the project as soon as possible, made branches and started to work. Every rush members sounds motivated and enthusiastic 💪🏻team</p>
<p>Day 21:</p>
<p>Oh no !, i made a mistake in understanding the problem logic.</p>
<p>found a new solutions and seams to be working fine. not yet tested with rigorous test cases.</p>
<p>not cleared norminette unfortunately. sadly going to get zero. but stretched alot. yea&hellip;</p>
<p>The evaluator on our rush was impressed even though we have not did with recursion and greeted for our work.</p>
<p>Day 22:</p>
<p>Target finish c04, and start c05;  achieved.</p>
<p>but in actual stuck with one exercise for several hours. 😭</p>
<p>Learned backtracking concepts.. very interesting. now could able to solve N*N queen problems.</p>
<p>need to work on different practical applications. found the fourth egg 😃</p>
<p>Day 23:</p>
<p>difference between Null and Zero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zero&rdquo; is a value. It is the unique, known quantity of zero, which is meaningful in arithmetic and other math.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Null&rdquo; is a non-value. It is a &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; for a data value that is
not known or not specified. It is only meaningful in this context;
mathematical operations cannot be performed on null (the result of any
such operation is undefined. A peer got norminette error but cleared moulinette..?  ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>Day 24: I don&rsquo;t have the feeling of sleeping. I am just lying down and thinking with the problem. Waking up with some solution. What is happening to me.?</p>
<p><a href="http://pythontutor.com/">Python Tutor - Visualize Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Ruby code execution</a></p>
<p>The best visualizer. Oh yea&hellip;!</p>
<p>Totally there were 175 students at starting each had 5 points. and 75 left approx. if they took 10 with them, the remaining 100 students will have only 1 point or less points and will make the system obsolete.  ¯*(ツ)*/¯</p>
<p>Day 25:</p>
<p>Day 26: final exam</p>
