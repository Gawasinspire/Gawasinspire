  <p>I spent the covid situation time with online courses and would like to list glimpses about some courses that i found it interesting.</p>
<p>Design Thinking by Chris Nodder</p>
<p>I was curious to learn how to improve software development process/methodologies in team. This course was quite interesting. It gave me ideas to find the important features to deploy and the significance of weightage of features of software. Ideation and time to market, proof of concept testing.. etc</p>
<p>Introduction to deep learning with OpenCV: by Jonathan Fernandes</p>
<p>As my project completely plays with OpenCV. I was demanded to empower myself with OpenCV computer vision libraries, and then i started with this course and learned the techniques and methods. I also found proper methods and utilized as per the requirement.</p>
<p>The tutor simplified many concepts such as YOLO algorithms, provided qualitative contents in Deep Neural Network.</p>
<p>Faster python code by Miki Tebeka.</p>
<p>This course is my personal favourite which I am planning to use in all personal projects. The code deals mostly with code optimization and fine-tuning performance of code execution.</p>
<p>The simple overview of the course is, have the checkpoint and determine where our code or software spends more time for execution and use efficient/optimized/simplified library sometimes need to replace the library itself to improve code execution speed. This course is completely comes with hands on code optimization workbooks found it worth having in each developer&rsquo;s local machine for reference.</p>
<p>Web scraping with python.
For Data Generation, mostly we need to simulate, generate or scrap it from the internet when the source is unavailable. So, I thought of playing with some professional techniques and what they are using in industrial workflow instead of using beautiful soup and the insights from the course were really help and saved time while working on the team project. I remember, i delivered the data by scrapping about 500 MB of data from good reads in less time without getting the blocked/ DOS from the webserver.</p>
<p>Introduction to Gratitude meditation.</p>
<p>If one want to sleep happily and live the life with full satisfaction, then this course is worth giving a try.
In shorts, The course to be thank full for what we are having and this could lead to inner peace and could attract more positive energy towards us.</p>
<p>Complete Linux training by Imran Afzal.
Every developer should taste Linuz at least once. Being a passionate Linux user, want to recall once again the basic concepts other than apt-get install or update commands.</p>
<p>This course gave a complete recap of the most important concepts and worth trying to refresh the Linux skills.</p>
<p>The online courses really a good hobby and awesome time killer with quality content. This kind of habit is not a one time process but the life long learning process which is a must to get better tomorrow from ourself.</p>
