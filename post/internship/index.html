  <p>Good, I cleared the interview, and I have been invited to Chemnitz for an internship and need to start my groundwork. And I need to apply for a passport and Visa. What to do now? I knew no one traveled on flights to whom I could personally speak. What is Visa. ? How much money do I need? Even my bachelor&rsquo;s complete education, including my hostel, is fully sponsored, I could not know what was waiting for me. How should I prepare for that..? What are the challenges.? After collecting an extensive list of questionnaires, I soon found the answers. First, I started reading about the place I was visiting, and the weather was shocking for me. Google told me the temperature could go minus degrees. Hello, I even can&rsquo;t withstand my local winter of 26degree. I don&rsquo;t have the proper dress and proper food. The Difficulty in communication. How to manage that? How to ask for help? What is the emergency hotline..? After a hard struggle, I barely memorized some German greetings. Hallo.. bitte &hellip; Danke and so on..</p>
<p>I obtained my passport and also applied and received German Visa from the German consulate. With the help of my friends' brother got some shoe winter jackets. My whole family, around ten members, were was waiting before the airport and sent me off. At the entry at Berlin immigration checking, I was so blabbering with many fears. The officer asked what the purpose of the visit was. I was expecting an answer for educational purposes. Instead, I explained the professor&rsquo;s name, the whole project in and out, what I was about to do, and meeting schedules. And she started laughing at and told. Viel Spa√ü.</p>
<p>After finding a room in Studentenwohnheim, I started to go out to play with snow. It was my first snow experience, and those white shiny, soft frozen water attracted me so much. But the next day is meeting with professor Stephen Odenwald, Institut of Sports Technik. So, I started to prepare for that. He was very friendly and frankly spoken with an open-minded. He showed interest and requirements and the kind of work he was looking.</p>
<p>My job is to learn about the intel Curie microprocessor and read about the gait analysis. I got my footprint into my first 32bit microcontroller experience. The board is quite interesting and offers plenty of resources. The idea of the job was to develop simplified gait analysis equipment, which could read the real-time accelerometer and gyroscopic values from the patient and help in monitoring and early-stage disease diagnostic prediction in health industries associated with gait analysis. At the end of two months, I contributed to developing the System. The real-time sensor values from the Microcontroller are sent to the Android app. The app was developed using MIT APP inventor through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>
<p>That was my first initiative with fewer boundaries to solve the problem. I was given the freedom to approach. The professor&rsquo;s friendliness and down-to-earth attitude impressed me a lot. Then I got the deep desire to travel with such a professor for a long. So I decided to pursue my M.s degree in Germany. Without German knowledge, I thought it would be pretty tricky. After collecting quite a few requirements for applying for M.S returned to India and submitted my bachelor work. Then I started working in embedded technology companies that supported college projects, and on the other side, I applied for college in Germany one by one.</p>
