      <description>I was born in a small village named vriddhachalam in December 1994 (*catchers.violinist.wakes) from Tamilnadu, India (south) and bought up in Salem (*accordion.ushering.shackles), a city famous for Mangoes, also often called as Steel City. The city is rich in bauxite ore. My Father is a weaver, and so do their forefathers. So weaving is like a family tradition for us. My parents want to give me the best education in the locality as all typical Indian parents do, and they put me in a CBSE school for secondary education.</description>
