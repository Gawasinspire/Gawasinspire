  <p>This simple exhibit got into many eyes in college locality. The chairman offered me an industrial IoT project. Wabco India is one of the leading manufacturers of reliable braking systems and provides a wide range of vehicle brake testing systems. A friend from other mechatronics departments and I jointly worked there to enhance an industrial automation job by making use IOT concept. There are several test rig systems, and whenever a rigged system overflows a certain threshold in terms of pressure or temperature, a human presence is demanded to solve the issue. My job is to make a logger which intimates the company notifies about the problems.</p>
<p>I have already played entirely with home automation systems and esp320 modules and made a simple app. I was planning to distribute the idea to mass production, but I proved the concept that it works. But could not implement a wide range of testing to assure the system&rsquo;s reliability. So, I hold the idea in later project ideas.</p>
<p>However, the esp modules' knowledge helped me complete that industrial IoT project for the test rig system. My contribution includes taking the temperature and pressure sensor reading into account, sampling with Analog to digital converter, and then comparing with a configurable threshold value. Finally, the readings are given to a web server. My partner sends the notification from the server to the end-user/client application via email.</p>
<p>This project was successful and earned my first recognition. IBM interviewed me for their book ShapeIT and mentioned my interview as one motivation to young engineering aspirants. Furthermore, this project gave me an internship opportunityâ€”an internship from TU Chemnitz in the sport Technique department. I planned to do my Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis with the training.</p>
