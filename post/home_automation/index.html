  <p>I visited a workshop in a college for the symposium and got to know about bare metal programming in C with AVR controllers. Then learned about the i2c protocol. Finally, I coded the controller to blink the LED light. It was so simple, but I was fascinated to control some light sources with my interest. This event gave me inspiration for a home automation project later.</p>
<p>Further spent time to learn SPI, UART, and IoT. I got into display modules and timers. I have made experimentations around with ESP modules. In the third academic year, our department students had to organize the symposium; I made a friendly website with decent UI (at least I found it remarkable at that time), used the template, and hosted it on the college server after editing and required sites. This contribution gave me an overview of HTML sites and their startup knowledge. Then for the home automation project used a website to control the relay. Then created a simple PHP website that allowed easy to convert into an android app. The esp modules acted as a web server, and the mobile devices connected with this hotspot with some authentication could turn off and turn lights via a relay.</p>
<p>This project gave motivation to my next project on Wabco.<a href="/post/wabco">link</a></p>
