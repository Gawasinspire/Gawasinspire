  <p>A considerable void filled my heart and mind after the Job and frustration of incomplete work due to Covid. I needed an immediate distraction, and I decided to participate in some intense coding competitions, and luck by chance, I found 42wolfsburg. That was fun at the start and occupied me more than I thought.</p>
<p>Students coded with bash scripts and C all day long. About 15 to 16 hours a day. The whole month each topic, like pointers, data structures, recursion techniques, in very depth. Finally, I got selected as piscine.</p>
<p>About 42 Wolfsburg are the school to train the student for technical jobs more into Volkswagen company. First, I need to get into the school by clearing a one-month evaluation. They test the student&rsquo;s reliability, ability to handle pressure and deadlines. After getting selected, I felt the school was not my cup of tea, which I am profoundly searched. I had a thirst for learning new stuff, not to redo the bash scripting. More on (link).
Furthermore, I switched to strive school to practice Machine Learning. In college, I started to finish the subjects like &ldquo;Intercultural competence, Technical English.&rdquo; These subjects are time-consuming but demand less effort.</p>
