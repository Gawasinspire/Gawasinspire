  <p>With his team of mechanical engineering students, a friend of mine approached me to support a competition where we needed to assemble an E-Bike. Being a third ECE  student endorsed the project and contributed to a built-in anti-theft and speed control system. The speed control system was inspired by a speech given by a guest lecture at my college. He told gatherings that in a luxurious car with a facility, the car owner controlled the electronic drives and explained further that the car owner could define the maximum speed that who can drive the vehicle can be constrained based upon the app.</p>
<p>I felt at that time why can&rsquo;t implement such a concept in the bike we are engineering. The work was so hard for newbies without proper planning and lacking precision in chassis manufacturing. The electrical drives also drowned my energy and motivation. At last, the bike worked. We managed to drive the E-Bike at the speed of 80km/hr max. Those were some extraordinary, memorable moments I spent in Vishnu women&rsquo;s engineering college.</p>
<p>In the end, The award was such a pleasing recognition, and the teamwork became an unforgettable experience.</p>
