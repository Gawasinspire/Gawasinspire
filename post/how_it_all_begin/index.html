  <p>I was born in a small village named vriddhachalam in December 1994 (*<em>catchers.violinist.wakes</em>) from Tamilnadu, India (south) and bought up in Salem (*<em>accordion.ushering.shackles</em>), a city famous for Mangoes, also often called as Steel City. The city is rich in bauxite ore. My Father is a weaver, and so do their forefathers. So weaving is like a family tradition for us. My parents want to give me the best education in the locality as all typical Indian parents do, and they put me in a CBSE school for secondary education. Only science competitions excited me on school days, and I have also participated got some district and state awards. I am an average student in my school days. I earned 8.0 (Cumulative Grade Point Average)CGPA (equivalent to 80%) from my secondary education. And unfortunately, I left the school and could not continue my higher education there. Due to severe health issues, I couldn&rsquo;t continue schooling for about one year. I invested in learning the c programming language. After graduating from high school with 80% received a full scholarship for engineering studies. I am also the first engineering student in my entire family. After completing high school, my neighbors used to engage in weaving to follow traditional work.</p>
<p>My fascination with physics motivated me to be active in laboratory and experiments. And during the second year, our lab assistant offered some pennies as a reward for the guys who finished assigned experimentations and took good results. That motivated me so far to get interested in circuits and devices lab. Some pieces of equipment in the lab used to malfunction, and hence the results within the given time are somewhat challenging. Only very few manage to take effect. Proper understanding of the devices and transistors eases the way for experimental results. So I won most of the time those rewards. Then a friend invited me to participate in an academic meet so-called symposium in fellow college. I experienced and won the first prize for debugging the circuits.</p>
<p>At the end of each academic year in my college, they conducted inter-level college meet to exhibit their projects the first year; I felt so incompetent to do so. Still, even I managed some entertaining computer games written in c for visitors, which gained feeble attention. Most of them from the crowd did not show interest in the methodologies and logic of the program but the end-user interface, on which they felt quickly bored for apparent reasons. The following year I made an amplifier circuit to amplify the audio signal, the concept was so old, and the project landed in sarcastic jokes. The following year, as usual, I got less pocket money and earned some cash by distributing daily newspapers to fellow students, saving 2000 rupees. On that occasion, the college established a center of excellence for robotics. They bought a Kuka robotic arm imported from Germany. The sponsors estimated to cost about 1crore in Indian rupees, equivalent to some million euros. That excited every fellow student. I got an idea to make a minimalistic version of that robot with less cost.</p>
<p>I also developed a prototype after spending two weeks of days and nights. I used polycarbonate sheets from construction materials. I used toy motors and forced them with PWM (pulse width modulation) signals to toy motors, which are simple dc motors that I could accommodate with my budget. I used an eight-bit AVR board for the projects, and the arm gained 3 degrees of the axis of freedom. The component could be able to lift 50 to 500gms of weight.</p>

<p>The project inspired most of the people around me and acted as a pavement for other future projects. In addition, this project provided me with the first ignition of valuable self-belief and self-confidence that I can create value.</p>
