  <p>After six months of slow application and preparation, I got admission to TU Clausthal. In the meantime, I worked in the project center to pay for my food. Then, I applied for the visa process. I got rejected due to insufficient funding. After saving and gathering, the budget got the visa. Then entered into Clausthal. With all excitement getting burst out in the first few weeks, I spent most of the time alone. It was pretty rare to see new people communicate. The supermarket workers soon became my friends.</p>
<p>After deciding to learn german, I gave my total effort to clear the levels at a single stretch little by little A1, A2, (A2.2, B1.1, B1.2, B2.1, B2.2, C1) in 6 months from Maria spring language institute. After that, I started thinking in the german language. After gaining the courage to speak out, I felt awful because I could not understand people preciously and adequately; even at worst, I could hardly convey what I was thinking. However, realizing a language is not a one-night learning process. This non-ending learning phase empowered me to enjoy local german news in FM and interact with people in all possible ways. They also helped engage me in local sports clubs and gave me a hobby activity as a Geocacher. In addition, offered pavement to enter into food saver community food sharing.</p>
<p>The language is not only about the data; it is about a culture, humanitarian values, people, embedded thoughts, and emotions.</p>
<p>We(Myself with two more friends) made vegetable briyani in the mensa Christmas fest. That was when I met a lot of people, about 200 people. I hardly believed this many people lived in Clausthal..! But the party was enjoyable. After completing my german courses and DSH, I don&rsquo;t wish to move to other colleges and cities. The Village became so affectionate for me with its pleasant scenic beauty. The college itself has a good reputation and ranking. I got a friend in the Wohngemeinshaft (WG)/ appartment. We spent time in Geocaching kinds of stuff and almost found all the caches nearby and became an active member in the local food sharing community.</p>
