  <p>Hiwi.  STM 32 and Arinc stories.</p>
<p>My first HiWi, after earning good grades in aeronautical informatics. I asked the professor for Hiwi Job to continue working with him. He offered me the job to implement an ARINC 653 on STM32. At first, I thought it would be doable and straightforward, but in reality, I need to learn more concepts to make things work in the way expected. Stm 32 is a powerful microcontroller, but bare metal programming is not a simplified Task like AVR chips. The complexity is increased a little more. But the STM community has many software for developers to work with free RTOS. But the job demands our RTOS. So started to learn and deploy schedulers, context switching. Step by step implemented applications with schedulers. Played with various os based interrupts rather than simple timer interrupts. And hard-coded the interrupts for Priority-based events-driven Systems. Finally, I extended the application developed for the academic subject over this ARINC. At the end of this work, the professor offered me the next job in the aerospace center. DLR. More details,</p>
